# Ariadne Python Plotter

## Project for Discrete Hybrid Systems exam @ University of Verona

### Objectives:
Main purpose of this project is to implement a way to visualize polytopes (hybrid enclosures) produced by python-binded version of [Ariadne](https://github.com/ariadne-cps/ariadne) C++ library. This plotting will be implemented employing [pyplot](https://plotly.com/) library.
A serialization tool in yaml will also be included. This will permit to export results in a more general way.
